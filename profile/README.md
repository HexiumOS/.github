# **Hexium OS Organization**

Welcome to the official **Hexium OS** GitHub organization! This organization hosts the development of **Hexium OS**, an experimental and innovative operating system written in **Rust**. Our mission is to explore and push the boundaries of low-level systems programming, using Rust as a foundation. Hexium OS serves as a platform for developers and enthusiasts to dive into the depths of operating system development, contribute to cutting-edge research, and create a next-generation operating system from scratch.

## **About Hexium OS**

**Hexium OS** is a modern, experimental operating system designed to explore the potential of **Rust** for systems programming. Rust, known for its memory safety and performance, is an ideal language for building low-level software like operating systems. Our goal with Hexium OS is to leverage Rust’s strengths to create a safe and efficient platform while also providing a valuable learning experience for anyone interested in OS development.

As Hexium OS evolves, we aim to introduce advanced OS functionalities such as memory management, multitasking, real-time process scheduling, and integration with hardware interfaces. We also plan to experiment with providing user interfaces, graphical environments, and various system services to complete the OS experience.

Hexium OS is a **community-driven project** open to contributions from developers of all experience levels. Whether you’re a beginner interested in learning more about operating systems, or an experienced developer looking to contribute, there’s a place for you in this project.

## **Vision and Goals**

The vision for **Hexium OS** is to create an operating system from scratch that will serve as both an educational tool and a platform for experimentation in low-level systems programming. Our primary goals include:

- **Learning and Experimentation**: To understand the underlying principles of operating systems through hands-on experience.
- **Community Collaboration**: To create a welcoming environment where developers can collaborate, share knowledge, and contribute to the project’s growth.
- **Exploring Rust in Systems Programming**: To explore Rust's potential in low-level programming, leveraging its memory safety features and performance in an OS context.

In the long term, Hexium OS aims to support common operating system features like file systems, multitasking, networking, graphics, and more—all while maintaining the core principles of safety, performance, and efficiency.

## **Why Rust?**

Rust is a systems programming language known for its focus on safety and performance. The language provides guarantees that help prevent many common programming errors, such as null pointer dereferencing, buffer overflows, and data races, which makes it an ideal choice for building low-level, high-performance systems software like operating systems. Using Rust, Hexium OS can safely interact with hardware, manage resources, and perform complex tasks while minimizing runtime errors.
